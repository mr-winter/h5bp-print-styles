# [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) â€“ Print styles

This is a repository containing only the print styles of the
[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) project. This was separated
from the project so that it could be separately published on NPM for use
in other CSS projects.

The main project is not published on NPM by the authors because it's
boilerplate code, and not a framework. Still, this CSS code makes for
a very decent print styles module.

The version of this package follows the version number of HTML5 Boilerplate,
except for the last number which is reserved for our own updates, and will
be updated whenever they update their print styles.

Please see the [https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate](html5-boilerplate)
project on Github for more information.
